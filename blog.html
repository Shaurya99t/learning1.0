<h2>varanasi my fav city</h2>
<p class="quote">Varanasi, also known as Benares,Banaras , or Kashi, 
is a city on the banks of the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh, India,
 320 kilometres (200 mi) south-east of the state capital, Lucknow, and 121 kilometres (75 mi) east of Allahabad.
 A major religious hub in India, it is the holiest of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism and Jainism,
 and played an important role in the development of Buddhism and Ravidassia.
 Varanasi lies along National Highway 2 and is served by Varanasi Junction railway station
 and Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport.

<p>Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes,
 ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE
 when he gave his first sermon, "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma",
 at nearby Sarnath. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century,
 when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi.
 During the Muslim rule through the Middle Ages,
 the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, mysticism
 and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education.
 Tulsidas wrote his epic poem on Rama's life called Ram Charit Manas in Varanasi.
 Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and Ravidas.
 Guru Nanak visited Varanasi for Maha Shivaratri in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the founding of Sikhism.

In the 16th century, Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the city,
 and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu,
 though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the Maratha and Bhumihar Brahmin kings.
 The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737,
 and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947.
 The city is governed by the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the Parliament of India
 by the current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, who won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by a huge margin.
 Silk weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population,
 as do the Diesel Locomotive Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals.
 Varanasi Hospital's foundation stone was laid by the then governor Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi
 in 1954 and it was inaugurated by former president S. Radhakrishnan in 1964.
